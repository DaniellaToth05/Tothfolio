        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            I have worked as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for multiple core computer science
            courses at the University of Guelph. In this role, I support students during labs,
            office hours, and assessments while helping them develop confidence in programming
            and problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
            TAing has strengthened my communication skills and reinforced my own understanding
            of foundational software concepts by explaining them clearly to others.

        <h3>CIS*1500 — Introduction to Programming</h3>
        <p>
            I worked as a Teaching Assistant for CIS*1500 across two terms, supporting students
            who were often encountering programming for the first time.

                <li>Explained core programming concepts in a clear and approachable way</li>
                <li>Worked with other TAs and instructors to support student success</li>

        <p>
            This role helped me learn how to break down complex ideas and adapt explanations
            based on a student’s level of understanding.

        <h3>CIS*2250 — Software Design II</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently a Teaching Assistant for CIS*2250, a course focused on the
            process of software design and the application of best practices for
            developing and reviewing software in a collaborative setting.
        </p>

        <p>
            The course places a strong emphasis on teamwork, communication, and
            responsibility in software development. Students work in pairs and small
            groups on design challenges and a substantial team-based software project,
            using Python as the implementation language.
        </p>

        <div class="list-wrap">
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Support students during in-person labs focused on pair and group work</li>
                <li>Assist students with Python-based lab work and project development</li>
                <li>Help students reason about software design decisions and trade-offs</li>
                <li>Grade labs, assignments, and exams and return feedback within required timelines</li>
                <li>Hold weekly office hours and respond to student questions through course communication tools</li>
                <li>Participate in regular TA meetings and assist with exam invigilation</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
            Supporting CIS*2250 has strengthened my ability to communicate software
            design concepts clearly and to guide students in reflecting on collaboration,
            design responsibility, and effective development practices.

        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p>
            Being a Teaching Assistant has improved my technical communication skills,
            patience, and confidence. It has also reinforced the importance of writing
            clear, maintainable code that others can understand.
