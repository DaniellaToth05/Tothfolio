        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            I am an Analyst with the Guelph Student Investment Council (GSIC), a student-managed
            investment fund at the University of Guelph. As part of the council, I contribute to
            equity research and investment decision-making through collaborative analysis and
            presentations.

        <h3>Role & Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
            As an analyst, I research publicly traded companies and evaluate them as potential
            investment opportunities for the fund. This role involves both independent analysis
            and close collaboration with other analysts.

        <h3>What I’ve Gained</h3>
        <p>
            Through GSIC, I have strengthened my analytical thinking, financial literacy, and
            presentation skills. The experience has also helped me become more comfortable
            working in a team environment where ideas are discussed, challenged, and refined.
